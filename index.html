      <h1 class="title">About of Cox's Bazar</h1>
      <p class="pragraph">
        Cox's Bazar is a town and a popular tourist destination located in the
        southeastern part of Bangladesh. It's known for having one of the
        longest natural sea beaches in the world, stretching for about 120
        kilometers (75 miles) along the Bay of Bengal. Here are some key points
        about Cox's Bazar: Beach: The main attraction of Cox's Bazar is its
        stunning sandy beach. It's a popular spot for both locals and tourists,
        offering opportunities for swimming, sunbathing, and various water
        sports. Tourism: Cox's Bazar has become a major tourist hotspot in
        Bangladesh. The town has developed a range of accommodations, from
        budget guesthouses to luxury resorts, to cater to the influx of
        visitors. Laboni Point: This is a central area of the beach, often
        bustling with tourists enjoying various activities, including beach
        cricket, horse riding, and kite flying. Himchari National Park: Located
        nearby, this park is known for its lush greenery, diverse flora and
        fauna, and beautiful waterfalls. It's a popular spot for nature
        enthusiasts and hikers. Inani Beach: A bit further south of Cox's Bazar,
        Inani Beach is another picturesque destination with golden sands and
        clear blue waters. St. Martin's Island: While not directly in Cox's
        Bazar, St. Martin's Island is a small coral island located nearby and is
        known for its stunning beauty and marine life. Fisheries: The local
        economy in Cox's Bazar is heavily reliant on fishing and seafood
        processing. The town is known for its seafood dishes and fresh catches.
        Ramu: A nearby town, Ramu is known for its Buddhist heritage and
        monasteries. It's a place where different communities and cultures
        coexist peacefully. Cultural Diversity: The region is home to various
        ethnic groups, including the Chakma, Marma, and Rohingya communities,
        contributing to its cultural diversity. Rohingya Crisis: In recent
        years, Cox's Bazar gained international attention due to the influx of
        Rohingya refugees fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar's Rakhine
        State. Refugee camps have been established in the area to provide
        shelter and assistance to these displaced people. Weather: The climate
        in Cox's Bazar is tropical, with hot and humid summers and mild winters.
        Monsoon season, from June to September, brings heavy rainfall. Cox's
        Bazar is a place of natural beauty, cultural diversity, and evolving
        significance due to its tourism and humanitarian aspects. However, it's
        important to note that circumstances and situations might have changed
        since my last knowledge update in September 2021.
